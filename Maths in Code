# You can do maths in programming too...

addition = 5 + 5
print(addition) # This will print 10.

multiplication = 5 * 5
print(multiplication) # This will print 25.

division = 5 / 5
print(division) # This will print 1.

# You can also do maths without saving the result in a variable.

print(100 - 42)

# Here are some mathematical operators you should know about:
# Addition [+], as in 5 + 5 = 10
# Subtraction [-], as in 10 - 2 = 8
# Multiplication [*], as in 5 * 5 = 25
# Division [/], as in 10 / 2 = 5
# Power Of [**] as in 2 ** 3 = 8
